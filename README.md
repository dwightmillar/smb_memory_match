This project was a fun one, and forced me to go out of my way to learn the intricacies of CSS and DOM manipulation in order to create the game I envisioned. In particular, I had to explore different ways to animate images such as CSS Keyframes and JS setInterval. I learned that different solutions worked better than others, like using GIFs for when Mario grows or shrinks instead of using CSS Keyframes and using JS setInterval to move the brick wall down when starting the game.
